This is a set of notebooks and exercises that can be used for a beginners course in 1 full day workshop format.

1. Session 1 walks through the basic for pandas and plotting libraries such as seaborn.
2. Session 2 provides some examples of regression, using both statistical linear model with statsmodel and black-box models in scikit-learn.
3. Session 3 touches on classification and some illustrated examples.

This is intended to give a taste of how machine learning in Python in a short period of time, a lot of basics in Python syntax and theoretical aspect of machine learning are not discussed.

# Google Colab Support (Updated May 2020)

The notebooks are now updated so that this can be run easily with Google Colab.

# Background of this material

A large part of this material was translated from a similar course in R created by the Hong Kong R User group back in 2017.
Thanks to contribution by various R User group members: Dr. C H Chan, Dr Jane Shen, Lucia Chen.
